# Nico Davin – Career & Tech Portfolio

Welcome – this repository is a central hub that links my professional experience with the projects I’m building in public on GitHub.

I have 20+ years’ experience in leadership, compliance, and systems management, and I’m now specialising in IT support and software development. This repo connects what I’ve done in the real world with the repos that demonstrate those skills in code, documentation, and systems design.
